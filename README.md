# 🌐 Eric Laine – Personal Website

Welcome to the source code for my personal website, built to reflect my journey as an educator, entrepreneur, and EdTech strategist. This site showcases my resume, skills, and projects with a warm, Minnesota-inspired aesthetic aligned with my LanguageLand EdTech brand.

## 🧭 About

I'm an EdTech innovator and multilingual communicator with over 9 years of global experience. This site offers a visual summary of my background in:

- 🚀 Educational Product Innovation
- 🎥 Social Media & Community Growth (200K+ followers)
- 🌍 Cross-Cultural Business Leadership (Fluent in Mandarin)
- 💡 EdTech & Literacy Program Development

The design is clean, calming, and built to feel trustworthy—like Minnesota lakes and blue skies—while staying modern and recruiter-friendly.
